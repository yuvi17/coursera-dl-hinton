Repo contains solutions to the assignments in the Deep Learning and Neural Network Course

by Proffesor Hinton from University of Toronoto on Coursera.

The solutions are in Octave (required by the course) as well as Python.

I have tried to keep the solutions are vectorized as possible. 

Will update as I go through the course.
